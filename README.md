# Restaurant Review Stage-1 Project

## Introduction

This project is part of the Udacity's Front-end Web Development Nanodegree courses that I took during 2017/11-2018/6. I started with starter code of a restaurent review site, and improved its responsiveness, accessibility and used Service Worker to make it available offline.

## Run the Site Locally (from Udacity project instructions)

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer: In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
